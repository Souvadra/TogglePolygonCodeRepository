## Instruction to the end-user to replicate the results

# Step 1: RACIPE Simulations (Three independent replicates for each network)

Detailed instructions about RACIPE is given [here:](https://www.google.com "RACIPE Code Repo")

The details of the networks are generated in a .topo file. For details, visit the above link. 
After the topo file is created, the compiled RACIPE can be run using: 
`./RACIPE <file>.topo -num_paras <number_of_parameter_sets> -num_ode <number_of_initial_conditions_for_each_parameter_set> -`
